## Stability issues
Thre are some limitations on nvidia gpu to consider.

First, the kernel is not 100% stable in all settings. This mean you'll have to experiment to find the stable sweet spot in term of gputhreads. Maximum thread count does not mean maximum speed. Sometimes lower thread count will give you more stability and more speed also.

On multiple gpu rigs, it's NOT recommended to mine CPU at the same time. You'll have more kernel timeout error because the driver will lack cpu time.<br>
Also, it is recommented, on multiple GPU rigs, to run the miner in a loop in a batch file !

Best way to find stability sweetspot's thread count is to divide total memory mb by 4.4 and then by 2<br>
Exemple: On GTX 1060 3gb, 3000 / 8.8 /2  = 170 gpu threads. Use that as a starting point for the -gputhreads parameter.

## Troubleshoot
On Windows 7/8/10, if you get the missing OpenCL.dll error you need to download it into rhminer's folder. (hint: You can safely get one with the Intel SDK on Intel's opencl website)


## Command line options
```
General options:
  -list                 List all gpu in the system
  -diff                 Set local difficulyu. ex: -diff 0.832
  -logfilename          Set the name of the log's filename. Note: the log file will be overwritten every time you start rhminer
  -extrapayload         An extra payload to be added when submiting solution to local wallet.
  -displayspeedtimeout  Display mining speeds every x seconds. Default is 10
  -processpriority      Set miner's process priority. 0=Background Process, 1=Low Priority, 2=Normal Priority. Default is 2. WARNING: Changing this value will affect GPU mining.
  -v                    Log verbosity. From 0 to 3. 0 no log, 1 normal log, 2 include warnings. Default is 1
  -disabledevfee        Before disabling developer fees, consider that it takes time and energy to maintain, develop and optimize this software.
  -completelist         Exhaustive list of all devices in the system
  -processorsaffinity   Force miner to only run on selected core processors. ex: -processorsaffinity 0,3 will make the miner run only on core #0 and #3. WARNING: Changing this value will affect GPU mining.
  -maxsubmiterrors      Stop the miner when a number of consecutive submit errors occured. Default is 10 consecutive errors. This is usefull when mining into local wallet.

Gpu options:
  -cpu                  Enable the use of CPU to mine. ex '-cpu -cputhread 4' will enable mining on cpu while gpu mining.
  -cputhreads           Number of CPU miner threads when mining with CPU. ex: -cpu -cputhread 4
  -cpurounds            Number of round per CPU cpu threads. Default is 50. ex: -cpu -cpurounds do 100. Each cpu thread will 100 hashes at a time
  -gputhreads           Cuda thread count. ex: -gputhreads  100 launche 100 threads on selected gpu
  -gpu                  Enable indiviaual GPU by their index. GPU not in the list will be disabled. ex: -gpu 0,3,4.
  -kernelactivewayting  Enable active wayting on kernel run. This will raise cpu usage but bring more stability, specially when mining on multiple gpu. WARNING: This affect cpu mining

Network options:
  -dar                  Disable auto-reconnect on connection lost. Note : The miner will exit uppon loosing connection.
  -s                    Stratum server or wallet address:port. NOTE: You can also use http://address.xyz to connect to local wallet.
  -su                   Stratum user
  -pw                   Stratum password
  -fo                   Failover address:port for stratum or local wallet
  -fou                  Failover user for stratum of a local wallet
  -fop                  Failover password for stratum or local wallet
  -r                    Retries connection count for stratum or local wallet
```

```
 Mining solo on cpu          : rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4009 -cpu -cputhreads 4 -extrapayload HelloWorld
 Mining solo on cpu and gpu  : rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4009 -cpu -cputhreads 4 -gpu 0 -gputhreads 262 -extrapayload HelloWorld
 Mining on a pool with 6 gpu : rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s stratum+tcp://somepool.com:1379 -su MyUsername -gpu 0,1,2,3,4,5 -gputhreads 400,512,512,512,210,512 -extrapayload Rig1
```

## Api access
Default port is 7111. Just sending empty string will return mining status in json format like that:
```

## Developer Donation
Default donation is 1%. <br>
Donation is hardcoded in the binaries downloadable on gitgub. That is to recoup the 6 month it toke to R&D, develop, stabilize and optimize this miner and for the upcoming bug fixes and many upcoming optimizations. <br>
To disable donation download and compile locally, then use the -disabledevfee option. <br>

For direct donations:
  * Pascal wallet 529692-23
  * Bitcoin address 19GfXGpRJfwcHPx2Nf8wHgMps8Eat1o4Jp
